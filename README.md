# Plotter
An iOS App that makes wall papers out of Strava Activities

## Future ideas to work on

  1. Need to allow for dragging to move items around the screen on the wallpaper view (Could ship to store after this).
  2. Need to create a settings page.
  3. Need to allow for changing the app theme colors to presets and even accepting user given hex values.
  4. Programmatically take/save screenshots.
  5. Give better user hints for what they can do to take a screenshot.
  6. Create the slight mappy background overlay option of wallpapers.
  7. Allow for mapping of multiple different runs.
  8. List additional stats for run (pace, HR, elevation, etc.).
