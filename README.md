# Plotter
An iOS App that makes wall papers out of Strava Activities

## Future ideas to work on

~~1. Need to allow for dragging to move items around the screen on the wallpaper view (Could ship to store after this).~~
  2. Need to create a settings page.
  3. Need to allow for changing the app theme colors to presets and even accepting user given hex values.
  4. Programmatically take/save screenshots.
  5. Give better user hints for what they can do to take a screenshot.
  6. Create the slight mappy background overlay option of wallpapers.
  7. Allow for mapping of multiple different runs.
  8. List additional stats for run (pace, HR, elevation, etc.).
